MATLAB code accompanying the publication "High infectiousness immediately before COVID-19 symptom onset highlights the importance of continued contact tracing" (available at https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65534).

Some scripts require the Chebfun package to run (freely available at https://www.chebfun.org/download/).

Scripts for producing the figures in our manuscript require the export_fig package to export the figure panels to pdf (freely available at https://github.com/altmany/export_fig).

The script for producing the violin plots in Fig. 3 requires the Violinplot-Matlab package to run (freely available at https://github.com/bastibe/Violinplot-Matlab).
